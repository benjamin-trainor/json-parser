### JSON Parser Project

# Goal

- To build my own version of `JSON.parse`

# Learning Objectives

- To dive deeper with learning TypeScript
- Learn different parsing techniques
- To implement and practice resursive programming
- To build a basic foundational knowledge of compilers, parsers, interpreters etc

# Steps to build this

- To take the result from `JSON.stringify` when it is passed a valid JS
- To iterate over that resultant string
- Tokenize chunks of that string according to data type
- Build a Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from those Tokens
- To then recreate the origional valid JS based off the AST
